The FIDIC Conditions of Contract "Red Book 99" places a lot of obligations and responsibilities on the Contractor in performing the Works under the Contract.

The Contract allows the Employer to terminate the Contract if the Contractor is failing (or has failed) to perform his obligations under the Contract (Clause 15).

Furthermore, it allows the Engineer to withhold payments of unperformed obligations until they are fulfilled (Clause 14).

It is thus very important for Contractors, Engineers and Employers alike to know the responsibilities and obligations of the Contractor under the General Conditions of FIDIC Red Book 99.

Here is a list of the major obligations of the Contractors under the General Conditions of FIDIC Red Book 99.

It is noteworthy to mention that these general conditions can be easily amended in the Particular conditions, and thus may be changed.

Moreover, this list is a only summary of the major obligations which may be used to withhold payment or send a Notice to Correct under Sub-Clause 15.1,  and is not an exhaustive list of the entire obligations of the Contractor.  

This list is intended to be used as a reference to the Sub-Clauses that provisions obligations on the Contractor, and shall not be used as a guide or a reference to the exact wording of the Contract.
