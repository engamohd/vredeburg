The FIDIC suite of contract templates is one of the most commonly used contracts in the construction industry around the world. Established in 1913, FIDIC stands for ?Federation Internationale des Ingenieurs - Conseils?, which is best translated from French as The International Federation of Consulting Engineers. 

The FIDIC Contracts Committee produces standard forms of contract for several engineering projects which are used globally. These contracts define fairly the contractual relationships, risks, responsibilities and liabilities between parties. Of these standard forms of contracts, the Conditions of Contract for Construction for Building and Engineering Works Designed by the Employer, commonly known as the "Red book", is one of the most used standard forms.

FIDIC uses a specific terminology in its contracts, and it is imperative for professionals working with these contracts to have a thorough knowledge of these terms.

Here is an aggregated glossary of all terms used in FIDIC contracts with its official definitions in all editions of FIDIC contracts.

Also available in excel sheet for Red Book terms along side with Arabic legal translation.
