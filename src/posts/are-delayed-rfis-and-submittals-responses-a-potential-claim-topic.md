It is common in construction projects to record hundreds of Request for Information (RFI), documents, material submittals etc. sent by the Contractor to the Engineer and awaiting instructions and/or approvals. More often than not these instructions or approvals are withheld or delayed, intentionally or not, which may burden the Contractor with delays and/or additional cost whilst awaiting for a reply from the Engineer.

FIDIC Red Book 99 discusses this issue in Sub-Clause 1.9 _\[Delayed Drawings or Instructions\]_ where the Contractor shall **give notice to the Engineer that the Works are likely to be disrupted if the necessary instruction and drawing is not issued in a particular reasonable time**. The Contractor shall then describe the details of the **said drawing/instruction, why and when it should be issued and the nature and particulars of the delay which could be suffered**.

If the Contractor incurs actual delay and/or Cost as a result of Engineer's failure to comply with the notice (unless that the Engineer's failure was caused by any error or delay by the Contractor), the Contractor shall give a notice of claim under Sub-Clause 20.1 _\[Contractor's Claims\]_ and proceed with the claim mechanism.

The Contractor may have his claim rejected if the Engineer argues that **failing to give the abovementioned notice** loses the Contractor his entitlement to any additional time and/or payment.

Therefore, I recommend that any such request/submittal (RFIs, shop drawings, material submittals, etc.) requiring an instruction or action by the Engineer under this Sub-Clause 1.9 should contain a reference to a date and Sub-Clause 1.9 in order to ensure that the submittal is in full accordance with the Contract.
